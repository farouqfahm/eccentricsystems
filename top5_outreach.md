Hi Chris,

Saw matrix JET CHARTERS on LinkedIn. Impressive growth from 2018.

Quick question: how long does it currently take your team to send a quote after an inquiry comes in?

Most operators I speak with say 2-6 hours. Given your marketing background, I'm guessing you've thought about automation.

We built an AI agent that quotes in 3 minutes and follows up automatically. One operator recovered $40K in lost revenue last month just from faster follow-ups.

Worth a 10-minute call to see if it fits matrix?

Hi Dirk,

20+ years in aviation - respect that. Titan Aviation Group has staying power.

With 1-10 employees, I'm guessing you wear a lot of hats. Sales, operations, admin.

Quick question: how many charter inquiries come in after hours that don't get quoted until the next day?

We built an AI agent that quotes in 3 minutes, 24/7. One operator recovered $40K last month from leads that would have gone cold.

Worth seeing if it could help Titan?

## 3. DANIEL DUNN - Aargus Air Charter

**Profile:** linkedin.com/in/aargusdanieldunn
**Company:** Aargus Air Charter (Grand Rapids, MI)
**Size:** Small (owner-operated)
**Role:** Owner since 1982 (!), Part 135 operator
**Background:** Pilot, ex-Frontier Airlines, ex-UPS

**Why he's perfect:**
- 40+ years in business = established but likely old-school systems
- Part 135 operator = actual fleet, real quoting needs
- Pilot background = understands operations
- Grand Rapids = underserved market (less competition)

**PERSONALIZED MESSAGE:**
```
Hi Daniel,

43 years running Aargus - that's incredible. You've seen the industry change.

Bet you've watched quoting go from phone calls to email to... still taking 2-6 hours?

We built an AI agent that handles charter quoting from inquiry to PDF in under 3 minutes. Follows up automatically. Never sleeps.

One operator recovered $40K in lost revenue last month.

Given your decades of experience, I'd value your take on whether this fits an operation like Aargus.

Worth a brief call?

**Follow-up angle:** Respect his experience ("you've seen tech come and go - this is different because...")

## 4. A. HERNANDEZ - AdévaJet

**Profile:** linkedin.com/in/junior-a-hernandez-042372274
**Company:** AdévaJet (NYC Metro)
**Size:** Solo founder
**Role:** Founder & CEO (started May 2025)
**Background:** New launch, luxury focus, Dassault/Bombardier/Gulfstream network

**Why he's perfect:**
- Brand new (2025) = building systems now, not retrofitting
- Solo founder = no bureaucracy, fast decisions
- Luxury focus = high-value quotes matter more
- NYC market = competitive, speed wins

**PERSONALIZED MESSAGE:**
```
Hi A.,

Saw AdévaJet launched in 2025. Congrats on the new venture.

Starting fresh means you can build smart from day one. Most operators I talk to are stuck with 20-year-old processes.

Question: as you set up quoting workflows, are you planning to handle them manually or looking at automation?

We built an AI agent that quotes in 3 minutes and follows up automatically. Perfect for new operators who want to compete with established players from day one.

Worth 10 minutes to see if it fits the AdévaJet model?

**Follow-up angle:** "Build it right from the start vs. retrofit later"

## 5. ION VRABIE - Challenge Jet Charter

**Profile:** linkedin.com/in/ionvrabie
**Company:** Challenge Jet Charter (UK)
**Size:** Small (founder-led)
**Role:** CEO & Founder since 2017
**Background:** UK-based, safety/privacy focused, HNWI clientele

**Why he's perfect:**
- UK market = expansion opportunity for Eccentric
- HNWI focus = high-value quotes, fast response matters
- Founder/CEO = decision maker
- 7+ years in = established but still agile

**PERSONALIZED MESSAGE:**
```
Hi Ion,

Challenge Jet Charter's focus on safety and privacy for HNWIs is spot-on.

In that market, response time is everything. HNWIs expect white-glove service, including instant quotes.

How long does it currently take Challenge Jet to turn around a charter inquiry?

We built an AI agent that quotes in 3 minutes, 24/7, with perfect consistency. One operator recovered $40K last month from faster follow-ups alone.

Given your client base, I think this could be a competitive advantage for Challenge Jet.

Worth a conversation?

**Follow-up angle:** "HNWIs expect instant everything - this delivers"
