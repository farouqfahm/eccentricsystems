## TEMPLATE 1: LINKEDIN CONNECTION REQUEST (Short)

**Subject:** Charter quoting question

**Message:**
{First Name}, saw {Company} specializes in {aircraft type/region}. Quick question: how long does it currently take your team to send a quote after an inquiry comes in?

Most operators I speak with say 2-6 hours. Just wondering if that's your experience too.

## TEMPLATE 2: LINKEDIN FOLLOW-UP (Value-First)

**Subject:** Re: Charter quoting question

**Message:**
{First Name},

Thanks for connecting.

We built an AI agent that handles charter quoting from inquiry to PDF in under 3 minutes (including flight time calc, fuel/landing fees, margins).

One of our beta operators recovered $40K in lost revenue last month just from faster follow-ups.

Worth a 10-minute call to see if it fits {Company}?

Best,
Umar

## TEMPLATE 3: COLD EMAIL (Problem-Agitate-Solve)

**Subject:** {Company} - losing charter deals to slow quotes?

**Body:**
Hi {First Name},

**Problem:**
The average charter operator takes 2-6 hours to send a quote. By then, the prospect has already gotten 2 faster quotes elsewhere.

**Agitate:**
70% of charter quotes die in inboxes with zero follow-up. That's revenue walking out the door while your team is busy with other tasks.

**Solve:**
We built an AI Quoting Agent for charter operators like {Company}:
- Receives inquiry (email/WhatsApp/web)
- Calculates quote in 3 minutes (flight time, fuel, landing, margins)
- Sends branded PDF instantly
- Follows up automatically at 24h/48h/72h
- Books confirmed trips, sends crew briefing

**Result:** One extra charter booking per month pays for the entire year.

**Price:** $1,500-2,500/month depending on fleet size.

Worth a 10-minute demo? I can show it working with a sample inquiry.

Reply YES and I'll send my calendar.

## TEMPLATE 4: SHORT COLD EMAIL (Busy Decision-Maker)

**Subject:** 3-minute charter quotes

**Body:**
{First Name},

{Company} looks like a solid operation. 

Quick question: how many charter inquiries do you get that never get quoted because your team is busy?

We built an AI agent that quotes in 3 minutes and follows up automatically. One operator recovered $40K in one month from faster response times alone.

$1,500-2,500/month. Pays for itself with one extra booking.

10-minute demo worth it?

## TEMPLATE 5: REFERRAL-BASED (If you have mutual connection)

**Subject:** {Mutual Connection} suggested I reach out

**Body:**
Hi {First Name},

{Mutual Connection} mentioned {Company} is growing fast and might be feeling the pain of manual quoting.

We built an AI agent specifically for charter operators that:
- Quotes in 3 minutes (vs. 2-6 hours)
- Follows up automatically (70% of quotes die in inboxes otherwise)
- Books confirmed trips and sends crew briefings

One of our operators closed an extra $45K charter last month from a lead that would have gone cold.

Worth a quick call to see if it fits {Company}?

## TEMPLATE 6: INDUSTRY NEWS TRIGGER (If competitor mentioned)

**Subject:** FlyJets launched JetGPT - here's the difference

**Body:**
{First Name},

Saw FlyJets launched JetGPT this month for flight-finding.

Different approach: we're building AI agents that run *inside* charter operations, not just help customers search.

Our Quoting Agent:
- Lives in your systems (not a marketplace)
- Knows your fleet, your margins, your crew
- Quotes in 3 minutes, follows up automatically
- Only you see the pricing

While FlyJets helps passengers compare, we help you close faster.

Worth 10 minutes to see the difference?

## TEMPLATE 7: BREAKUP EMAIL (Final attempt)

**Subject:** Closing the loop

**Body:**
{First Name},

Tried reaching out a couple times about our AI Quoting Agent for {Company}.

No worries if timing isn't right. I'll assume you're all set unless I hear otherwise.

If things change and you want to see how AI can cut your quoting time from hours to minutes, just reply and I'll send my calendar.

Either way, best of luck with {Company}.

## LINKEDIN INMAIL (Premium)

**Subject:** Charter quoting at {Company}

**Body:**
{First Name},

Most charter operators lose 3 out of 5 deals because they're too slow to quote.

We built an AI agent that quotes in 3 minutes and follows up automatically.

One operator recovered $40K in lost revenue last month.

Worth a conversation?

## RESPONSE HANDLING

**If they say "Not interested":**
"No problem. Out of curiosity, what's your biggest operational headache right now? Always researching pain points for charter operators."

**If they say "Send info":**
"Happy to. What's your email? I'll send a one-pager and a 2-minute demo video."

**If they say "Too expensive":**
"Got it. Just to clarify - one extra charter booking pays for a full year. But I understand budgets are tight. Want to start with a pilot program at $800/month?"

**If they say "We have a system":**
"Nice! What are you using? We're not trying to replace working systems, just augment where humans are the bottleneck."
