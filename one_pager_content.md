## SUBHEADLINE

We build AI agents that automate the repetitive work in charter operations: quoting, scheduling, follow-ups, and reporting. One extra booking per month pays for the entire year.

---

## THE PROBLEM

**Charter operators are losing deals because they're too slow.**

- 2-6 hours to send a quote manually
- 70% of quotes die in inboxes with zero follow-up
- Customer emails pile up while staff juggles operations
- No-shows and empty seats cost thousands per month
- Owner does sales AND operations (no time for either)

---
